# Intro

I am a sophomore and QuestBridge Scholar at Yale University studying Computer Science and Economics. I'm also pursuing a Certificate in Data Science. I am a motivated, detail-oriented, and responsible student interested in exploring the intersections of business and emerging technology for social good.

# Currently

At Yale, I'm an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for the [Computer Science department](https://cpsc.yale.edu/), a coordinator for the [Student Technology Collaborative](https://studenttechnology.yale.edu/student-resources/about-stc) (the student arm of the IT support team), and the Treasurer for [Code Haven](http://codehavenyale.org/), a club dedicated to teaching computer science to students from under-resourced schools and communities. I'm also involved with the Yale Computer Society and Yale Effective Altruism.
